# Image_classifier-CNN
This code is able to implement an image classifier using the concept of the transfer learning.In transfer learning we extract and transfer a number of layers form a pre-trained convolutional neural network called AlexNet-which has been trained on enormous amount of data. Then, we combine these transferred layers with new classifier ,that is related to user problem.
